//Expression wacky - How much does a major League salary average per contract on 4 random selections?

var contract1 = 1.5;
var contract2 = 2.5;
var contract3 = 2.1;
var contract4 = 3.5;

//the average is the sum of the items divided by the number of items 

var average = (contract1 + contract2+ contract3 + contract4)/4;
console.log(average);
